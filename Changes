        Correct a major issue : Mr Tatsuhiko Miyagawa wasn't in the module credit ! 
        My deep apologies to Mr Miyagawa.
        Also fix the lacking documentation. 
        No code modification.

        First release. Support JSON, XML/KML output and translation from/to these formats.
        This version is still messy since we use it in our internal development as a test module.
        Particularly the toKML() method is the worst with its static code.
        All those things will be corrected in the next release (in few days).
