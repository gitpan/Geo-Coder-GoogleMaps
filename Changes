Revision history for Geo-Coder-GoogleMaps

0.1    2007-05-28
        First release. Support JSON, XML/KML output and translation from/to these formats.
        This version is still messy since we use it in our internal development as a test module.
        Particularly the toKML() method is the worst with its static code.
        All those things will be corrected in the next release (in few days).
